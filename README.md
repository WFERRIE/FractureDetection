# FractureDetection

Note that some images and code had to be removed from the notebook so that it fit within Github's <25mb file size limit. Additionally, the 2gb of image data was also omitted.

This project was done for a deep learning course I took as part of my Master's. In the world of geotechnical engineering, geology, mining, and petroleum-related applications, fracture analysis in subsurface formations is critical, as it allows for determination of rock quality, borehole stability, and more. The traditional method for fracture analysis is to visually inspect drill core samples and manually identify and log the fractures. This is a very labour intensive process and is very subjective. Therefore, myself and a team of three others created a computer vision model using a fine-tuned [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) model to automatically perform this fracture detection process.

The data (images of drill core samples) came from [MinEx CRC NDI East Tennant](https://minexcrc.com.au/ndi-drilling-campaigns/) - a prominant Australian-based mineral exploration company. The data was granted through a formal request made to the company, and included over 600 images, which our team manually labelled with bounding boxes for two classes: fractures, and depth markers (markers included in the drill core image indicating the depth at which the sample was collected from).

My contribution to the project was in the data cleaning and model creation. I first extracted all of the label information from the software my teammates used for labelling, and reformatted it into the YOLO format. I created a train, validation, and test set, and imported a YOLOv8 model and performed 100 epochs of fine-tuning. The best model was selected based on the validation set, and was evaluated for its Precision-Confidence Curve, and F1-Confidence Curve. These plots evaluate the precision and F1 scores respectively for both classes across varying confidence levels predicted by the model. 

Our final model performed very well on the test set, and was even able to generalize to new data it had not seen before (other rock fractures not in our train/val/test sets). Overall we are very pleased with our results, and feel that with a larger dataset, even better results can be achieved.
